This is my Pet App. I have designed this following Replit's Intro to Java course. 

The project asks the user if they are a pet owner and if the animal they envision is a pet. If both questions are answered with, "true", the app informs the user that they are using the app for its intended purpose.

Afterwards, the app asks the user for the pet's name, animal type, weight, age, and height. After each question is asked, the app displays a message to show the user's input. Finally, the app displays all the user inputs.
